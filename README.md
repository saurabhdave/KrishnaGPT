## UPDATE

The leaked model had been removed by OpenAI. Until a new model is found, i'll use the default text-davinci-003

## Supported Platforms

- iOS 15 and above

## Requierements
- Xcode 14 
- Register for API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api)
- Create API Key
- Paste API key in KrishnaGPTApp file where the ChatGPTAPI instance is declared

```swift
let api = ChatGPTAPI(apiKey: "API_KEY")
```

## How it works

This initiative employs the OpenAI GPT-3 API, specifically the text-davinci-003, in a streaming manner. It formulates a prompt based on the user's input and the desired format, then forwards it to the GPT-3 API. The received response is then streamed back to the app.
